# 🎯 PROJECT RULES (ENTRY POINT)

This repository follows a strict "Agent Governance Protocol." Before performing any task, writing any code, or suggesting any architectural changes, you MUST read and adhere to the core protocol.

## 🧠 CORE PROTOCOL
Location: `AGENT.md`

## 🛠️ QUICK COMMANDS (FROM PROTOCOL)
- **Backend:** `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
- **Tests:** `pytest backend/tests/` | `npm test`
- **Linting:** `ruff check .` | `npm run lint`

## 🏗️ MODULARITY PRINCIPLE
This file serves as the technical bridge for IDEs (like Cursor/VS Code). The reasoning logic and project philosophy reside in `AGENT.md`, and custom scripts reside in `command_patterns/`. If you are an AI agent, your first action should be to load this context.
